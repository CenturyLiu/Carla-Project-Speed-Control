    "# Carla vehicle throttle-brake control\n",
    "This is a brief demonstration of how to control carla vehicle based on throttle and brake. The codes is almost the same as the [throttle-only-control](https://github.com/CenturyLiu/Carla-Project-Speed-Control/blob/master/draft/throttle_only_control.ipynb), except that I add brake torque to the vehicle if the vehicle is decelerating.\n",

    "### Part 1: Prerequisites for using the code below\n",
    "Follow instruction on [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.3/intro.html#), install the python control package.\n",

    "### Part 2: Control system design\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [carla vehicle control document](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.VehicleControl), a carla vehicle's speed can be controlled by throttle, brake and gear. For simplicity, I only implemented the control with throttle. For more detailed car-control model, see [python-control example: cruise control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.3/cruise.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "The system is a simple unity feedback loop control system, with a \"controller\" block, and a \"vehicle\" block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"vehicle\" block in the diagram represents the carla vehicle we want to control. The vehicle takes the throttle input, use the throttle value interacting with the environment and report its forward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"controller\" block is the one we need to design. Here, I implemented a simple block PI controller.\n",
